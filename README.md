# Krite

Krite is a web based system where users ("kveg") can log on, see their balance,
and purchase various products sold at Dypet.

They can also pay for a sauna session, or buy a sauna season pass.

Dypet administrators can log in, see available stock, update stock, and change prices.
Automatic stock reports can also be generated and downloaded.
